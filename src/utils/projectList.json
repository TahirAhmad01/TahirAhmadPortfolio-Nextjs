The available courses will be chosen by the students under a user authentication process. Registered courses should be listed under a specific semester for each student.There should be search activity by Semester Name so that we can see the registered courses under that semester.Admin can create a semester and mark the semester as the current semester.Lastly Admin will update the each semester result and result will be published calculating the CGPA of each subject and result will be emailed to students.Each student will be able to see their own result through his registered email id."
